Hello readers, in this series I would like to invite you to learn together about basic accounting. Surely many of you have an interest in this discipline. The reason is, an accountant is always needed by all companies, both trading, service and manufacturing companies.

the jobdesk of an accountant in the company is to ensure that all financial flows are recorded physically into a financial report, which will later be presented to stakeholders for further decision making.
