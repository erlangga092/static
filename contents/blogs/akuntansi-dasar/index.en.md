Hello readers, in this series I would like to invite you to learn together about basic accounting. Surely many of you have an interest in this discipline. The reason is, an accountant is always needed by all companies, both trading, service and manufacturing companies.

Accountant's jobdesk in the company is to ensure that all the flow of financial movements is recorded physically into a financial report, which will later be presented to stakeholders for further decision making.

## Knowing Accounting
Various sources explain what accounting is, such [American Accounting Association](https://aaahq.org/) which defines accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and reporting economic information to enable clear and assertive judgment and decision-making for those who use that information. 

## Basic Terminology of Debit and Credit
The terms [Debit](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit) and [Kredit](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kredit_(akuntansi)) must be encountered when studying accounting, and keep in mind that these two terms do not mean an `increase` or `decrease` but to describe where journal entries are made. The left side means debiting the account, while the right side means crediting the account. An account can be said to have a `debit balance` if the debit amount exceeds the credit amount, and vice versa.

The following is the basic terminology of debit and credit.

## Basic Accounting Equations
In a paired system, for each debit there must be a credit and vice versa, so that when you compare the debit and credit side of the accounting report it will be balanced, so the basic equation formula will be obtained as follows.

```javascript
Assets = Liability + Stockholders Equity
```

Then to make it easier for you later in making financial reports, the following is the accounting cycle from the beginning of the transaction to the making of financial reports.
